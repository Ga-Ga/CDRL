# CDRL
This is an anonymous github repo for the supplementary video results of "Contrastive Decoupled Representation Learning and Regularization for Speech-Preserving Facial Expression Manipulation".

We compare SPFEM models with and without CDRL on MEAD and RAVDESS datasets.

Each frame of the video contains 4 images, which are source, reference, results of SPFEM baseline, and results of CDRL from left to right.
